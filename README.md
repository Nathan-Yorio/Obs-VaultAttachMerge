# Obs-VaultAttachMerge
very simple golang script to rename all attachments folders in an obsidian vault to be compatible with another vault's naming scheme

## Using the script
- if you have go installed you can simply download the source and do a
```sh
go run main.go
```

- if you want you can download the release binary and run that instead
```sh
./Obs-VaultAttachMerge
```

- If you want to compile a binary for windows instead of linux there is plenty of golang documentation on how to do that from this source
